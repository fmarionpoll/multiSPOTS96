Icy plugin to analysze  consumption of dry drops of sugar (called "spots") by fruitflies, contained in the wells of a 96-well plate.

multiSPOT96 is an acronym for (multiple) spots over a 96 well plate. With this plugin, you can analyze stacks of images collected during experiments where flies are contained in a 3D-printed frame placed over the top of a 96-wells plate. In our current design, one webcam is monitoring 48 flies at once, which have access to the area defined by 2 wells.  from a 98-wells plate, thanks to a 3D-printed cage placed on top of it. By sampling 4 images.s, we can measure how much and how fast flies feed from spots of 0.5 Âµl colored sugar deposited deposited over a transparent plastic plate. The liquid spotted is (generally sweet water added with a blue dye and another substance to test.

MultiSPOTS96 is written in Java and runs under Icy. It uses extensively the wonderful library designed by Stephane Dallongevile and Fabrice de Chaumont (Institut Pasteur).
