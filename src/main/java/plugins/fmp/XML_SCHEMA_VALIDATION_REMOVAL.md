# XML Schema Validation Removal

## Overview
Successfully removed XML schema validation from the specified classes in the multiSPOTS96 Maven project. This change allows the application to read XML files without requiring schema validation, which can improve performance and reduce dependencies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Experiment.java
- **Location**: `multiSPOTS96/experiment/Experiment.java`
- **Method**: `load_MS96_experiment()` (lines 346-348)
- **Change**: Removed schema validation call to `XMLSchemaValidator.validateXMLDocument()`
- **Impact**: Experiment XML files can now be loaded without schema validation

### 2. CagesArray.java
- **Location**: `multiSPOTS96/experiment/cages/CagesArray.java`
- **Method**: `xmlReadCagesFromFileNoQuestion()` (lines 235-237)
- **Change**: Removed schema validation call to `XMLSchemaValidator.validateXMLDocument()`
- **Impact**: Cages XML files can now be loaded without schema validation

## Classes Checked
The following classes were examined and confirmed to **NOT** use schema validation:
- **Spot.java**: No schema validation found
- **SpotsArray.java**: No schema validation found  
- **Cage.java**: No schema validation found
- **CageArray.java**: No schema validation found (this appears to be the same as CagesArray.java)

## Benefits
1. **Improved Performance**: Eliminates schema validation overhead during XML loading
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: No longer requires schema files to be present
3. **Simplified Loading**: XML files can be loaded even if schema files are missing or corrupted
4. **Better Compatibility**: Works with XML files that may not strictly conform to schemas

## Technical Details
- Schema validation was implemented using the `XMLSchemaValidator` class
- Validation was performed against two schema types:
  - `SchemaType.EXPERIMENT` for experiment XML files
  - `SchemaType.CAGES` for cages XML files
- The `XMLSchemaValidator` class remains in the codebase but is no longer called during XML loading operations

## Verification
The changes maintain the existing XML loading functionality while removing the validation step. XML files will still be parsed and loaded correctly, but without the strict schema validation that could cause loading failures.

## Files Modified
1. `multiSPOTS96/experiment/Experiment.java`
2. `multiSPOTS96/experiment/cages/CagesArray.java`
