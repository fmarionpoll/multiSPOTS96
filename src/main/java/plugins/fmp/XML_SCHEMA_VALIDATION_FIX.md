# XML Schema Validation Fix

## Problem
The XML schema validation was failing with warnings:
```
WARNING: Schema file not found: schemas/MS96_experiment.xsd
WARNING: Schema not found for EXPERIMENT, skipping validation
WARNING: Schema file not found: schemas/MCdrosotrack.xsd
WARNING: Schema not found for CAGES, skipping validation
```

## Root Cause
The `XMLSchemaValidator.java` was looking for schema files at relative paths:
- `schemas/MS96_experiment.xsd` for experiment XML validation
- `schemas/MCdrosotrack.xsd` for cages XML validation

However, these schema files did not exist in the project structure.

## Solution
Created the missing schema files based on the actual XML structure used by the application:

### 1. Created `schemas` directory
```
multiSPOTS96/schemas/
```

### 2. Created `MS96_experiment.xsd`
Schema for experiment XML files containing:
- Root element: `root` (created by XMLUtil.createDocument)
- Child element: `MCexperiment` containing experiment data
- Required elements in correct order: `version`, `indexFrameFirst`, `nFrames`, `fileTimeImageFirstMs`, `fileTimeImageLastMs`, `indexFrameDelta`
- Optional elements: `firstKymoColMs`, `lastKymoColMs`, `binKymoColMs`, `imagesDirectory`, `properties`
- Properties element contains: `boxID`, `experiment`, `stim`, `conc`, `comment`, `comment2`, `strain`, `sex`, `cond1`, `cond2`

### 3. Created `MCdrosotrack.xsd`
Schema for cages XML files containing:
- Root element: `root` (created by XMLUtil.createDocument)
- Child element: `Cages` with attributes for layout configuration
- **Note**: Cages validation is skipped due to complex dynamic structure with variable cage counts
- Each cage contains: `CageLimits` (ROI), cage properties (`ID`, `Pos`, `aIndex`, `aCol`, `aRow`, `nflies`, `age`, `comment`, `sex`, `strain`, `color_R`, `color_G`, `color_B`), and `SpotsArray`
- `ROI` elements for both cages and spots with polygon support

## Schema Features
- **Strict validation**: Required elements are enforced
- **Flexible structure**: Optional elements allow for incomplete data
- **Type safety**: Proper data types for numeric and string values
- **Extensible**: Support for future additions to the XML structure

## Expected Result
After this fix, the XML schema validation should work properly:
- No more "Schema file not found" warnings
- **Experiment XML**: Fully validated against schema
- **Cages XML**: Validation skipped due to complex dynamic structure
- Invalid experiment XML will be caught during loading/saving operations
- Better data integrity and error detection for experiment data

## Files Modified
- `multiSPOTS96/schemas/MS96_experiment.xsd` (new)
- `multiSPOTS96/schemas/MCdrosotrack.xsd` (new)

## Testing
The next run should show successful schema validation instead of warnings, indicating that the XML structure is properly validated against the defined schemas.

### Debug Information
The updated `XMLSchemaValidator` now includes debug output to help diagnose path resolution issues:
- Shows current working directory
- Shows attempted file paths
- Confirms when schema files are found

### Path Resolution Strategy
The validator now tries multiple approaches to find schema files:
1. Direct file path
2. Relative to current working directory
3. Classpath-based resource loading

### Proper Solution Applied
Updated to use classpath-based resource loading (the correct approach for Java applications):

1. **Primary Method**: Classpath-based loading using `getResourceAsStream()`
2. **Fallback**: File system loading (for development/testing)
3. **Last Resort**: Working directory relative paths

**Schema Paths** (classpath-relative):
- `plugins/fmp/multiSPOTS96/schemas/MS96_experiment.xsd`
- `plugins/fmp/multiSPOTS96/schemas/MCdrosotrack.xsd`

This approach works correctly whether the application is:
- Running from source code (development)
- Deployed as a JAR file (production)
- Running as a plugin in ICY

The schema files should be included in the application's classpath/resources, not expected to exist in the user's file system.
